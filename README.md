Blackjack, otherwise known as Twenty-One, Vingt-et-Un, or Pontoon, is a classic card game, approximately 250 years old.

The goal of the game is to get a hand of cards that’s worth as close to 21 points as possible. If a player’s hand goes over 21 points, they have lost.

The player is initially dealt two cards. They may then choose to ‘hit’ (draw a card) or ‘stand’ (stop drawing cards.) If they ‘hit’, then the new card’s value is added to the hand total. If this total exceeds 21, the player is ‘bust’, and loses.

Once all players have finished this process, the highest scoring hand wins.
